# Plaimanas Test Project

This repository contains a static frontend prototype for the *Plaimanas* website. It's a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript demo showcasing a responsive navigation menu, form inputs, and other UI components.

## 🛠️ Features

- Responsive desktop/mobile navigation with:
  - Animated burger menu that morphs into a cross
  - Full‑screen mobile panel with support for dropdown submenus
  - Fixed-position submenu on desktop that ignores parent transforms
- Floating labels for form fields that hide on input value
- Custom styled selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- Accordion and tab components powered by jQuery
- Marquee text animation

## 📁 Project Structure

```
index.html          # main page
assets/
  css/style.css     # all styles (using SCSS-like nesting manually)
  js/script.js      # interaction logic (uses jQuery + AOS)
  image/            # media assets used by the page
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a static project, no build step is required. To run locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd plaimanas-test
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. For development it's convenient to run a simple HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server` or the Live Server extension in VS Code).

## 🧩 Dependencies

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) (via CDN for utility classes)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for DOM interactions
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) for scroll animations

## ✏️ Customization
Modify `assets/css/style.css` to tweak colors, layout, or add new components. JavaScript behaviors are located in `assets/js/script.js`.

## 💡 Notes
- Inputs rely on the `placeholder` attribute for floating label behavior.
- Mobile menu is controlled by `.burger-menu` and toggles `.menu-mobile.active`.

Feel free to extend or reuse the code for your own frontend prototypes.
